GD::Convert Module

GD::Convert is a pure perl module which provides additional output
functions for the GD module: ppm and xpm. These formats are useful if
you need to dynamically create photos for Tk. Standard Perl/Tk does
not accept any of GD's output formats: png only via the additional
Tk::PNG module and jpeg only via the additional Tk::JPEG module. So if
you cannot compile on your system, this module is for you.

To install, type

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make install
	$ make test

For Windows NT and ActiveState Perl, replace "make" with "nmake".
Otherwise, just copy Convert.pm to C:\Perl\site\lib\GD (create this
directory if not existing).

Some tests are interactive if Tk is installed. If you don't like this,
define either the environment variable DISPLAY="" (so there are no Tk
related tests at all) or BATCH="yes" (the Tk tests will run, but the
user does not have to click on a button to exit the test programs).
